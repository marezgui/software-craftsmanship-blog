# My Software Craftsmanship Blog

This blog is an introduction to **software craftsmanship**, built using a Next.js template created by [ijjk](https://github.com/ijjk).It leverages static site generation (SSG) and Notionâ€™s private API as a backend. Currently, it features two articles exploring the basics of this approach to writing quality code.
